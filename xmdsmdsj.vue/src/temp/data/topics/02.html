<h3>Goal:</h3>

<h4>Improve the import html file process</h4>

<p>
  So far, in the virtual data server, it is painful to create each single html file and set a reference to them manually one by one.
  Therefore, I'm going to introduce a smarter way to import html files.

<p>
  I thus require that the import way shall be auto identify the number of html files and set the id of articles based on their file names.
