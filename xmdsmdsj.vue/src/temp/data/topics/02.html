<h3>Goal:</h3>

<h4>Improve the import html file process</h4>

<p>
  So far, in the virtual data server, it is painful to create each single html file and set a reference to them manually one by one.
  Therefore, I'm going to introduce a smarter way to import html files.
</p>

<br>

<p>
  I thus require that the import way shall be auto identify the number of html files and set the id of articles based on their file names.
</p>

<h3>Steps:</h3>

<ol>
  <h4><li>Try to use nodejs fs module to read files in a folder</li></h4>

  <p>
    However, it seems that this is not working. "fs" module will throw an error out in Vue. Maybe I can try that later. But since reading
    files directly from the server rather than database is not a good idea, I think trying to do this is meaningless.
  </p>

  <h4><li>At least, try to import html files dynamically.</li></h4>

  <p>So I fisrt built a list for setting ids and titles of a html file. Then, try to import the html file based on its id. The code is </p>

  <code>
      function getAllPosts() {
        let allPosts = [
          {
            id: '01',
            html: '',
            title: 'test'
          },
      
          {
            id: '02',
            html: '',
            title: 'test'
          },
        ]
      
        allPosts.forEach((item, index, arr) => {
          import('@/temp/data/topics/' + item.id + '.html').then( module => item.html = module.default);
        });
      
        return allPosts;
      }
      
      export { getAllPosts };
  </code>

  <p>Now its importing dynamically.</p>
