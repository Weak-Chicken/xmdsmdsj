# Authentication System Part 2

## Authentication System on Frontend

---

### Goal

In this part, I'll try to build a log in pannel in the frontend. This is quite straightforword. It has the following requirements:

1. There is a little button on topleft called 'log in / register'
2. When cilcked, it will buring the user to a log in page and notify the user that register is currently not opened.
3. The log in pannel should allow the user to log in by email and password
4. Once logged in, change the topleft 'log in / register' button to another button which has the name of that user.
5. Use fake data in this process. DO NOT use data from backend. That is what we will do next.

### Steps

1. Change the position of 'about' and place 'log in / register' button at where the 'about' was

> First, align 'about' to the left after 'up coming'. 
> Then create an authentication page at that place
> After that, create two components: 'log in' and 'register' for this page.
> Finally, add those two componenets to that page. Let that page switch them based on user's choice.

> (I've just noticed that log in operation can be done only by vue. So may check that later and have a try.)
