# Authentication System on Backend

## Goal

In this part, I'll try to build a fully functional authentication system on the backend part. It has the following requirements:

1. It will accept register.
2. It will accept login.
3. It will protect user's password during they are transmitting.
4. It will distinguish different users and give them different rights. At this stage, a user can be either user, admin, superadmin.
5. Level "user" will have no special functions at this stage.
6. Level "admin" will have no special functions at this stage.
7. Level "superadmin" will have full control of the whole website.
8. It will accept an account suspend operation. Only the user itself can suspend its own account. When accounts are suspended, DO NOT remove them from database.
9. Once an user suspended its account, only super admin can revert this operation.
10. Currently, deleting account is not allowed.
