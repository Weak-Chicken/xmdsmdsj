# Overall Rules

Please record all versions in versionHistory.md.

I'll use 3 digits for distinguishing versions. Form like 0.0.0

The first digit represents large changes such as sturcture changes(change the type of frontend, backend, database etc.).

The second digit represents function changes. Such as whole authentication function, including log in / out, suspend your own account etc.

The third digit represents small goals reached. For example, goals like log in function, log out function. 

Normally, the changes in the first digits will be recoded in directionOfThisWeb.md file. It will clearly show the meaning of these numbers. Then, the changes in the second digits will be recoded in different topics. For example, 00003.md file recorded the authentication on backend. Finally, the changes in the third digits will be based on the process of realizing the goals in the second digits. But it is not necessarily the same with the sub-goals illustrated in the goal documents.
