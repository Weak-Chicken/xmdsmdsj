# Special Work

## Improve Appearance

---

### Goal

In this part, I'll do some extra improve work to make my web looks better. This is not part of my main job since I'm now focusing on technique part rather than UI design part. However, because my web so far is really ugly (Sorry to say that :( ), I think it is necessary to make some improvements there.

There is no explicit goals for this part. I will just record what I have changed in the following 'steps' part to remind myself.

### Steps

1. Improve the apperance of md files.
