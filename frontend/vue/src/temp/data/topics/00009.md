# Article Part

## Showing Articles on Our Page

---

### Goal

Now we have finished the very basic logging in system. Although there are still many bugs in there (For example, you have to re-login if refreshing the page.), I will leave it there and maybe working on that later. For now, our priority is to build our article displaying page.

In this part, our main job is to make basic article uploading, showing and deleting functions. It requires:

1. Logged in user can upload articles into their account. 
2. Logged in user can see all its articles in its account page. Logged in user can see a button on their account page to let them upload their articles.
3. When articles are uploaded, database will record its uploaded time, last modified time etc. Anyway, extra infomation will be recorded.
4. Uploaded articles will be shown in '/article/', no matter which user uploaded it. The title of it will be shown with a hyperlink to the details of this article.
5. Click on article page could get into the article, where you can read the article and see the details.

### Steps

1. Create fake data in frontend for articles.

> First, according to our working procedure, we need to first create our fake data in data provider for our frontend. Then, after well tested, write this fake data structure into our API document and implement it in our backend and database. Therefore, the fake data need to be considered seriously.

> Inspired by [cnodejs topic API](https://cnodejs.org/api/v1/topics/?page=1&limit=10), I decide to define my fake data with these extra data. Here it contains only three articles as an example.
