### Goal

This article is mainly used to record some small problems which might be annoying but not critical to our users for one stage. And in this ariticle, we will try to solve these problems to give our users better experiences.

1. Log in status cannot be remembered. Once refresh, the log in status is forgot.
2. There is no logout option available.
3. Remeber users even they closed their computers. Not only remember them among pages.
4. Build a page to notify users to login rather than using a simple alert now.
5. Press 'enter' cannot login on login page.
6. Upper and Lower case issue in backend and database.
7. It is quite ugly when our web display articles in .md files. Find some methods to make it looks better, especially for those code.
