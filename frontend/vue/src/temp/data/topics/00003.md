# Authentication System Part 1

## Authentication System on Backend

---

### Goal

In this part, I'll try to build a fully functional authentication system on the backend part. It has the following requirements:

1. It will accept register.
2. It will accept login.
3. It will NOT protect user's password during they are transmitting at this stage.
4. It will distinguish different users and give them different rights. At this stage, a user can be either user, admin, superadmin.
5. Level "user" will have no special functions at this stage.
6. Level "admin" will have no special functions at this stage.
7. Level "superadmin" will have full control of the whole website.

---

### Steps
0. Before Working on this

> I have set the MySQL database before we start. I created a schema called 'expressdb' and created a table under it named 'User'. Then I use 'uuid' as the primary key. I defined three columns, they are 'userName', 'pwd', 'userEmail'. Users will need them as their logging in credits. 
>
> Besides, I also defined 'userBio' and 'userLevel' for it. 'userBio' is used for an example for query users. At the same time, 'userLevel' is used to define which level the user should be.
>  
> And if you come across the error that your machine IP is rejected by the database, please log into the data base and set 'host' of your account to '%'

1. Write SQL configs in Express.

> In the /backend/ folder, make a dir called 'db'. And since we may change our db option, here we make a dir called 'sql' under 'db' dir. Now, we can put all our sql settings or configs for express in this dir.
>
> First, let's put our logging info in. Create a js file called sqlConfigs and export the sql configs from there.
>
> Here I run my database on 192.168.240.141 on port 3306. These are my configs:
>
> ```js
> module.exports = {  
>   mysql: {   
>     host: '192.168.240.141',     
>     user: 'root',   
>     password: 'password',  
>     database:'expressdb', 
>     port: 3306  
>   }
>  };
> ```
>
> Also notice that I have create a schema in SQL called 'expressdb'.

2. Write SQL query for express

> To let our backend: Express to send queries to the database, we need to write query operations for it. Here we'll use user as an example. Based on what I have defined in the database, here we write three methods for it:
>
> 1. Get user by id(uuid)
> 2. Get all users (To be clear, when you get users here, you can only get their name, uuid and bio. DO NOT get their password or email etc.)
> 3. Add / Insert one user to the database
>
> With these three opertaions, we should be able to write log in / out operation and register opertaion.
>
> Now, we create a js file named 'userSqlOp.js'(User SQL Opertions) under db/sql/. In the file we put these code:
>
> ```js
> var UserSQL = {  
>   insert:'INSERT INTO User(uuid,userName,pwd,userEmail,userBio,userLevel) VALUES(?,?,?,?,?,?)', 
>   queryAll:'SELECT * FROM User',  
>   getUserById:'SELECT * FROM User WHERE uuid = ? ',
> };
> 
> module.exports = UserSQL;
> ```
>
> Later we will explain how to use these code to connect our backend with our database.

3. Write login method in Express

> Now our express is ready to operate our database. We can now write our log in method in our backend.
> To do that, we need to create user APIs. Find the 'router' folder under express root folder, create a dir called 'apis', and under it, create another dir called 'v1'. This would be helpful when you later manage your apis acrossing different versions. 
>
> First, under the 'v1' dir, create a js file called 'User.js' to store all APIs in path /User/.
>
> Then, in this file, we need to import our libraries. Use these code to import libs.
>
> ```js
> // Use express module
> var express = require('express');
> var router = express.Router();
>
> // Use SQL modules with our configs
> var mysql = require('mysql');
> var mysqlConfig = require('../../../db/sql/sqlConfigs');
> var mysqlUserOp = require('../../../db/sql/userSqlOp');
>
> // Build a connection pool for sql connection
> var mysqlPool = mysql.createPool(mysqlConfig.mysql);
> ```
>
> After that, now we can build our APIs by  ```router.get``` or ```router.post```.
>
> However, when I try these two methods, I realized one problem: I cannot get the req.body in post method. When I tried to get infomation from req.body, I got only null value from it.
>
> Then from [This Blog](https://blog.csdn.net/TyrionJ/article/details/81990048) I think it might be body-parser reason. However it is not. I imported body-parser according to the blog, but my server cannot run this time. It will not respond to any request once body-parser is on. After I searched online and read some more blogs, I found nothing can explain this. Finally, I think I should read the Express [offical document](http://www.expressjs.com.cn/4x/api.html) and luckily it explains that 
>```js
> app.use(express.json());
> app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
>```
> 
> has replaced the original body-parser statements (Which are mentioned in the blog):
>
> ```js
> app.use(bodyPaser.json)
> app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false})) 
> ```
>
> Therefore, using body-parser is a dead way.
>
> However, my problem is still there and I cannot receive any data from client post body. Then I realized that our server is accepting x-www-form-urlencoded data not form-data I sent in Postman. So I changed it and everything works fine.
>
> <img alt="Postman-formdata" src="../img/3/postman-formdata.png">
> <div align=center>Using form-data</div>
> <img alt="Postman-x-www-form-urlencoded-data" src="../img/3/postman-x-www-form-urlencoded-data.png">
> <div align=center>Using x-www-form-urlencoded-data</div>
>
> Now, sinces I have found the problem, I think I can try to let Express support for form-data. So I search it on offical document and found in [here](http://www.expressjs.com.cn/4x/api.html). The offical document said:
>> In Express 4, req.files is no longer available on the req object by default. To access uploaded files on the req.files object, use multipart-handling middleware like busboy, multer, formidable, multiparty, connect-multiparty, or pez.
>
> So I'm going to try using middleware to deal with this problem.

4. Using connect-multiparty to support form-data in post
 
> After searching I decide to use connect-multiparty. Basically, to enable form-data support, all we need to do is import it in router files, and use it in .post function.
>
> The example of it is given as:
> ```js
> var multipart = require('connect-multiparty');
> var multipartMiddleware = multipart();
> app.post('/upload', multipartMiddleware, > function(req, resp) {
>   console.log(req.body, req.files);
>   // don't forget to delete all req.files when done
> });
> ```
>
> So now, our user.js looks like this:
> ```js
> // Use express module
> var express = require('express');
> var multipart = require('connect-multiparty');
> var router = express.Router();
> 
> // Use SQL modules with our configs
> var mysql = require('mysql');
> var mysqlConfig = require('../../../db/sql/sqlConfigs');
> var mysqlUserOp = require('../../../db/sql/userSqlOp');
> var multipartMiddleware = multipart();
> 
> // Build a connection pool for sql connection
> var mysqlPool = mysql.createPool(mysqlConfig.mysql);
> 
> // User login
> // DO NOT use 'get' here. Use 'post' to secure > user's password.
> router.post('/Login', multipartMiddleware, (req, res, next) => {
>   // Get connection from connection pool
>   // mysqlPool.getConnection((err, connection) => {
>   //   if (err) throw (err);
> 
>   //   console.log(req.body);
>   // });
>   res.send(req.body);
> });
> 
> module.exports = router;
> 
> ```
> 
>
> Now, let's move on. Since post sending problem has been solved, I then tried to log in the SQL database and failed. The error I received is:
>> Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client
>
> This is caused by the SQL client version is too low. Although I have upgraded my SQL client in nodejs, it is still not new enough.
> 
> So the solution is simple. Since our client cannot be changed (I'm already the newest version) and I don't want to change my server version (It's not an easy stuff to reinstall the database). So I decide to reset my password to older version. This can be done by
>
> ```sql
> USE mysql;
> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your new password';
> ```
>
> And during resolving this problem, I got another error from the database terminal
>
> ```bash
> ERROR 1396 (HY000): Operation ALTER USER failed for 'root'@'localhost'
> ```
>
> After searching it on the Internet, I realized that this is beacuse I changed the host for my root account. To allow it log in from anywhere, I changed the host to '%'. Therefore, for me, I should use 
>
> ``` sql
> ALTER USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your new password';
> ```
>
> And now I can connect to the database;
>
>
> After all those problems, we now can finally create our log in api. The method is quite straightforward: First, divide all variables according to API document. Second, use the keyword to send query to database. Here we will allow user to login through either their email address or their user name. Third, return the results. Here three situations will be considered: 1. Logging in succeeded. 2. Password or username error. 3. User is not registered.
>
> Based on our plan above, I then tried to add login API. You may have noticed that the question mark "?" we used before
> ```js
> connection.query('SELECT * FROM `books` WHERE `author` = ?', ['David'], function (error, results, fields) {
>   // error will be an Error if one occurred during the query
>   // results will contain the results of the query
>   // fields will contain information about the returned results fields (if any)
> });
> ```
>
> And for the fields in here, I'm quite confused about what is the "results fields". So I printed out the results of ```onnection.query(SELECT * FROM User WHERE uuid = ? , [1], function (error, results, fields)```
>
> This is my results:
>
> ```json
>{
>     "results": [
>         {

5. Build a register api

> Like the login API, we still work in User.js file. This time, we create an API to listen at User/Register/. And when this api is called, we would like the information of the user can be inserted to our database.
>
> ```js
> // User register
> // DO NOT use 'get' here. Use 'post' to secure > user's password.
> router.post('/Register', multipartMiddleware, > (req, res, next) => {
>   // Get connection from connection pool
>   mysqlPool.getConnection((err, connection) => {
>     if (err) throw (err);
> 
>     let [
>       uuid,
>       userName,
>       userPwd,
>       userEmail,
>     ] = [
>         parseInt(req.body.uuid),
>         req.body.userName,
>         req.body.userPwd,
>         req.body.userEmail,
>       ];
> 
>     connection.query(mysqlUserOp.insertSimplfied, [uuid, userName, userPwd, userEmail], (error, results, fields) => {
>       if (error) {
>         console.log(error);
>         res.send({
>           'success': false,
>           'flag': flagCode.ERROR_UNKNOWN_USER_REGISTER_ERROR,
>           'error': error,
>         });
>         return;
>       };
> 
>       res.send({
>         'success': true,
>         'flag': flagCode.INFO_USER_REGISTER_SUCCEEDED,
>       });
> 
>     });
>     // Release the connection
>     // connection.release(); // might not work
>     mysqlPool.releaseConnection(connection);
>   });
> });
> ```
>
> Of course there are more works to do.
>
> First, do validate the info provided by users.
>
> Second, try to write a 'send and return' function.
>
> And don't forgot to remeber why using ```console.log(error)``` instead of ```throw(error)```. And some ```throw(error)``` may still in the code, remeber go to change them.
>

6. Let Express deal with sessions and cookies

> Only login is not enough. Our backend should be able to remeber those who have logged in and gives correct authentications to these users.
> 
> To do that, we need to introduce sessions and cookies to our Express.
> 
> First, install cookie-parser and express-session
> 
> Ask the difference between session and cookies. I know that sessions are stored on the server and cookies are stored on the client. But if we already have cookies, why do we need sessions? we can identify different users already, can't we?
> 
> 
> 

7. Build an authentication change API. 
  
> Where a user has higher level can get a user list which contains users who have the same and lower level.
> In addition, the user at higher level can change the authentications of the user at lower level
>
>
> Got a problem:
> ```
> connection is not defined
> 
> ReferenceError: connection is not defined

> 
> ```
>  throw err; // Rethrow non-MySQL errors
>      ^
>
>Error [ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT]: Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client
