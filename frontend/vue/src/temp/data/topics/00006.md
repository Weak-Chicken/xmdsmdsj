# Decision

I think it is worth emphasizing at here that, in this project, it is the frontend to decide which APIs are needed.

To make this more clear, now I decide that to following this development procedure: First, just normally build the front. Then, there must be some data requirements. So, make some fake data in frontend. These fake data should be stored in Json form. After that, write our API documentations based on these fake data. Finally, when frontend finished developing and the APIs are fixed, build those APIs in backend and set database accordingly.

DO NOT develop APIs from backend. When working on backend, it is hard to tell which APIs are needed and which APIs are making sense.

Always do this:

> frontend -> fakeAPI -> fixedAPI -> API Documents -> backend & database
